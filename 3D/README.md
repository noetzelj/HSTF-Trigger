Design Goals:

Based off version 1...a couple of design update ideas

1) No PLA - warps in the hot summer sun - PETG
2) Color black is okay, blends in with camera
3) Provide lock for PTT - keeps the "loose" problem from happening
3a) Also allow to cover over left side buttons so no accidental lights / freq changes to FM, etc
4) Use clip screws to firmly mount into place
5) Provide multiple 1/4 #20 bolt connections so easily mountable - include hotshoe mount option
5) Parasitic power from radio battery - must work with regular and extended power

Step 1)
- Build radio back base plate
  - screw in plate with PTT lock (M2.5..approx length 10mm)
  - allow for bolts / screws for later circuit board mounting
